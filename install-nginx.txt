This file provides instructions using NGINX web server on linux.
From Wikipedia
    Nginx is a web server with a strong focus on high concurrency, performance and low memory usage.
    It can also act as a reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer and an HTTP cache.


This file assumes the following :
  application code is currently cloned/copied to location  /home/ubuntu/crams-nectar
   - if the code location is different, change the appropriate values in the instructions below.


1. install nginx
   - For centOS/Rhel use instructions at https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/
   - For ubuntu : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts
     - alternatively
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install nginx

2. Create a config file for web application to be deployed
   2.1 Copy /etc/nginx/sites-available/default and create a new file  /etc/nginx/sites-available/crams-nectar
   2.2 edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/crams-nectar
       For non-SSL service, modify the server section where listen is set to 80
       server {
            listen 80 default_server;
            listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

            root /home/ubuntu/crams-nectar/app;
            index index.html index.htm;

            # Make site accessible from http://localhost/
            server_name localhost;

            ...
            ...
            ...
       }

       2.2.1  Ensure the web application code location is correctly set in the root parameter
       2.2.2  For a SSL service, modify the server section at the bottom where listen port is set to 443
              Make sure the ssl_certificate and key params are correctly set

   2.3 For Staging and Prod env with (Sub)domain name, set the appropriate server_name param

3. Create a symbolic link to sites-enabled folder
   ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/crams-nectar /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

4. During installation, the nginx application should be setup to auto start on machine restart.
   - if not try
       sudo chkconfig nginx on       or
       sudo update-rc.d nginx defaults

5. Nginx Server can be managed manually by typing the following command
   sudo service nginx stop   <== to stop server
      - (or) start, restart  <== to start or restart
